# Stopwatch Timer Project
### This project is a simple stopwatch timer implemented using an AVR microcontroller. The timer displays the time on a 4-digit 7-segment display and uses three push buttons for control: start, resume, and stop.

# Components
### AVR microcontroller
### 4-digit 7-segment display
### 3 push buttons
### Timer0
# Features
### Stopwatch timer with hours, minutes, and seconds display
### Start, resume, and stop functionality controlled by push buttons
### Display updates every 10ms
### Timer implemented using Timer0 and interrupts
### LCD display for debugging purposes
# How to use
### Connect the components to the AVR microcontroller as shown in the Video Below.
### Compile and upload the code to the AVR microcontroller.
### Press the start button to begin the timer.
### Press the resume button to resume the timer after it has been stopped.
### Press the stop button to stop the timer.
### The time will be displayed on the 4-digit 7-segment display.
# Notes
### This code was written using the Eclipse IDE.
### The delay library used is from the avr-libc library.
### The code assumes that the AVR microcontroller is running at 8MHz. If running at a different frequency, the prescaler value in Timer0 should be adjusted accordingly.
